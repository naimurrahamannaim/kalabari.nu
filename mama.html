            <p>I really enjoyed the whole journey. After leaving Dhaka city, the side view was really amazing. I love to
                see
                natural beauty. When we came near Sylhet, I was watching tea gardens. It’s a great experience for
                everyone.
                Now
                I want to travel by train again. </p>
